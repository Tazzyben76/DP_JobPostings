# Data Pipeline : Job Postings

### Overview:
Developed an end-to-end data pipeline to collect, process, and analyze job postings data, providing insights into industry trends, skills demand, and salary benchmarks. The project demonstrates proficiency in data engineering, ETL processes, and data visualization.

**Key Features:**
- Data Ingestion: Automated scraping and API integration to gather job postings from multiple sources on a scheduled basis.
- Data Processing: Cleaned, normalized, and transformed raw data using Python and SQL, handling missing values and inconsistent formats.
- Storage & Management: Stored processed data in a structured database, enabling efficient querying and analytics.
- Analytics & Insights: Generated visualizations and summary statistics to identify trends in job titles, locations, required skills, and salary ranges.
- Automation: Scheduled the entire pipeline using workflow orchestration tools to run end-to-end without manual intervention.

**Technologies Used:** Python, SQL, Pandas, BeautifulSoup/Scrapy (for scraping), APIs, PostgreSQL/MySQL, Airflow (or your orchestration tool), and visualization libraries (Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly).

**Impact:**
This project provides actionable insights for job seekers and recruiters, demonstrating the ability to handle large datasets, automate workflows, and transform raw data into meaningful business intelligence.
